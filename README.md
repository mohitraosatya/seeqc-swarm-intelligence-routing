#  BOA-CRYO: Bio-Inspired Optimization for Scalable Quantum SFQ Routing

##  Project Summary

**BOA-CRYO** (Butterfly Optimization Algorithm for Cryogenic Routing) is a nature-inspired optimization framework designed to address a critical bottleneck in scalable quantum computing: **the complexity and inefficiency of SFQ-based control wiring for superconducting qubits**.

This project simulates ultra-complex quantum-classical hybrid circuits — modeled on SEEQC’s quantum control stack — and applies **Butterfly Swarm Intelligence** to significantly reduce routing complexity, energy load, and thermal noise risk.

---

## Motivation

As highlighted by SEEQC's CTO, **Dr. Shu-Jen Han**, one of the main roadblocks to scaling beyond 1,000+ qubits is:

- The **explosion in control and readout wiring**
- **Energy inefficiency** of driving qubits from room-temperature electronics
- The challenge of **co-locating SFQ logic and qubits** at cryogenic temperatures

> SEEQC’s ERSFQ logic already solves the energy part.  
> **BOA-CRYO solves the wiring complexity part.**

## Inspiration from Nature

Butterflies coordinate swarms to locate nectar using **energy-efficient** and **distributed behavior** — no single butterfly knows the best path, but as a swarm, they discover it faster than random search.

This project uses that same **swarm logic** to optimize SFQ wiring paths in large quantum control graphs.

## System Overview

- Simulates **qubit + SFQ + control node graph** with 70+ nodes and 300+ interconnects
- Uses **Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA)** to explore and converge on optimal SFQ routing paths
- Minimizes a custom cost function representing **thermal complexity**, **energy**, and **path congestion**

## Why SEEQC Should Care

-  **Cryogenic bottlenecks are physical and urgent**  
  Every wire added between control chips and qubits increases the **thermal load**, which is catastrophic at millikelvin temperatures. BOA-CRYO helps **intelligently route signals**, reducing this overhead significantly.

-  **Pairs perfectly with SEEQC’s ERSFQ technology**  
  You’ve already solved the energy problem. This helps solve the **routing and thermal congestion** problem, enabling **more qubits per package**.

-  **Aligns with SEEQC’s chip-based quantum control strategy**  
  BOA-CRYO can be integrated into your design flow to **auto-optimize control/readout interconnects** during layout or packaging.

-  **Provides a scalable optimization layer**  
  Whether you're at 100 or 10,000 qubits, BOA-CRYO’s metaheuristic approach can scale — just as butterfly swarms scale with complexity in nature.

##  Next Steps

-  Integrate into a **streamlined SFQ layout CAD tool**
-  Add **multi-objective optimization** (thermal + timing + reliability)
